## ÔøΩ Approach

The eGain Laptop Advisor follows a two-phase recommendation approach:

### **Phase 1: User Profile Collection**
The chatbot systematically gathers information about the user through a structured conversation flow:
- **Purpose Identification**: Determines primary use case (Work, Gaming, Student, Creative)
- **Gaming Specialization**: For gaming users, identifies casual vs. high-end gaming preferences
- **Budget Assessment**: Captures price range preferences across four tiers
- **Profile Building**: Constructs a comprehensive user profile with all collected criteria

### **Phase 2: Data-Driven Recommendations**
Using the collected user profile, the system:
- **Dataset Matching**: Queries our curated laptop database (`laptopData.json`) containing 16 laptop models
- **Criteria Filtering**: Matches laptops based on exact purpose and budget criteria
- **Personalized Results**: Delivers tailored recommendations with detailed specifications
- **Contextual Presentation**: Shows CPU, RAM, GPU, storage, and pricing information

This approach ensures that every recommendation is precisely matched to the user's stated needs and preferences, providing relevant and actionable laptop suggestions.
